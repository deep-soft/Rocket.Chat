Implemented a new "Pending Users" tab on the users page to list users who have not yet been activated and/or have not logged in for the first time. 
Additionally, added a "Pending Action" column to aid administrators in identifying necessary actions for each user. Incorporated a "Reason for Joining" field 
into the user info contextual bar, along with a callout for exceeding the seats cap in the users page header. Finally, introduced a new logic to disable user creation buttons upon surpassing the seats cap.
